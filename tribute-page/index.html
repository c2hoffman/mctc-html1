<h1 id="tribute-headline">Willem Dafoe</h1>
<h2 id="tribute-subheadline">A Man of Many Faces</h2>
<p id="tribute-info">Since 1980, Willem Dafoe's distinctive face has appeared in at least 113 separate movies. In 2023 alone, he starred in 7 different films.</p>
<p>
Here's a selection of fun facts that we've learned from this cinema icon's accomplished history on the big screen!</p>
<h3>1. He was fired from his first film role.</h3>
<p> Though uncredited, Willem Dafoe played a small part in <i>Heaven's Gate (1980)</i>. He was hired for his "ethinic face", but was fired when it was discovered that he didn't know how to speak Dutch.</p>
<h3>2. He is unaware of his distinctive face.</h3>
<p>Despite being well-known for his larger-than-life expressions, Dafoe often remarks that he himself does not believe he has a particularly unique face. That being said, he has learned over the years that others do not agree, and has been told multiple times about his unique appearance.</p>
  <h3>3. He dropped out of college.</h3>
 <p>Dafoe originally studied at the University of Wisconsinâ€”Milwaukee. According to him, he took as many acting and film courses as he could for about two semesters. After 18 months, he left to pursue an acting career rather than continue with his general education.</p>
<p>In 2022, he returned to the university and was awarded with an honorary diploma.</p> 
<h3>4. He lived in a small fisherman's cottage.</h3>
<p>While filming <i>The Lighthouse (2022)</i>, a film full of torrential rain and solitary environments, Dafoe did not join the crew and his co-stars in staying in a hotel. Instead, he opted to stay in a humble fisherman's shack by himself<p>
<p>When asked if this counted as method acting, he had this to say:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/willem-dafoe-interview-face-hollywood-cover/"><div id="blockq"><p id="blocktext">Would I call myself method? Not by the normal definition, I don't think, no.</p>
<p id="blocktext">I mean, I'm always changing my acting. The reason I always stay on set is because I always like to practice. But that's more so I can hang out and see what's going on.</p></div></blockquote>
<h3>5. He kind of looks like my dad.</h3>
<p>I don't know! It's something about the jawline, I think. They both have a pretty gritty voice too.</p>
